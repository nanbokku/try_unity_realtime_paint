I can update texture in realtime using `CustomRenderTexture`.

- using `RenderTexture` and computing world coordinates directly
- using `CustomRenderTexture` and computing world coordinates by output vertex map in advance

# Requirement

- Unity2019

# Usage

Paint a target object by mouse clicks

# Note

I tested an environment under windows only.
